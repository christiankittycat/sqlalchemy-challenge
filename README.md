I’ve decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I’m conducting a climate analysis of the area. This project will guide me through analyzing and exploring climate data using Python, SQLAlchemy, and other tools. The following sections outline the steps I need to accomplish this task, including data exploration and creating a Flask API.

In the first part, I’ll perform a basic climate analysis and data exploration using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I’ll start by connecting to my SQLite database using SQLAlchemy’s create_engine() function and reflect the tables into classes with automap_base(). I’ll conduct a precipitation analysis by querying the previous 12 months of precipitation data, loading it into a Pandas DataFrame, and plotting the results. Additionally, I’ll perform a station analysis to find the most-active stations, calculate temperature statistics, and plot temperature observations.

The second part involves designing a Flask API based on the queries I developed in the initial analysis. I’ll create routes to display the precipitation data, list of stations, and temperature observations. I’ll also implement dynamic routes to provide temperature statistics for specified date ranges. Using Flask’s jsonify function, I’ll convert my query results into JSON format. This project will help me gain insights into Honolulu’s climate and enhance my trip planning with valuable data.
